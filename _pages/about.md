About me
======

Hi, I'm Jarrid!  I'm currently a research Master's student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec) and the Université de Montréal where I'm supervised by Professors
[Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org) and [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in).  Before joining Mila, I completed my undergraduate studies at the
University of Michigan where I was a member of [Barzan Mozafari](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mozafari/)'s lab.

My current research interests can broadly be summarized as the application of machine learning for humanitarian goals.  I presently work on using
active learning and graph representation learning to aid drug discovery, but I'm also interested in algorithmic fairness, optimization theory,
and various topics in reinforcement learning.  I also really like distributed systems (I spent my undergrad in a systems lab).

# Misc
Besides work, I live with my brilliant partner, our dog Ella, and our cat Clementine. 
I love hiking, listening to music, drumming (I’m nostalgic for my college marching band days), 
and playing video games.  If you've got any questions, or would just like to chat, don't
hesitate to reach out!
